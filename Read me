This project detects the drowsiness of drivers by capturing video frames of eye closure patterns. 
This system consists of a small security camera pointing directly into the drivers face. 
It monitors the eyes of the driver and their closure patterns. The face area and position of eyes are pinpointed by the viola-jones object detection algorithm. 
It uses a 6- coordinate of eye to seek out whether eyes are close or open, using a haar cascade classifier. 
When 20 consecutive frames are detected with eyelids aspect ratio less than 0.25, then the system comes to a result that the driver is drowsy and issues an alert.
